2020-04-25 - OAuth2 Event Modeling in Go - Part 2

1 hour and 45 min presentation for the [Vancouver Event Driven Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Event-Driven/events/270252670/).

This was a presentation, followed with a long Q&A session, about implementing OAuth2 in Go using CQRS and Event Sourcing focusing on Process Managers. We discussed breaking down the OAuth2 domain into events, turning those into an event model, and implementing a solution guided by tests. We then dove deep into the embedded [RangeDB](https://github.com/inklabs/rangedb) Event Store and explored the implementation details in an exciting Q&A session.
