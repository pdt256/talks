2018-05-09 - Beginner Arduino Workshop

2 hour hands-on workshop for the [Code Craft](https://www.meetup.com/codecraftgroup) meetup group.

Jamie Isaacs will be your guide to building fun projects using the Arduino platform. We will explore how to get started with embedded projects using LEDs, buttons, and buzzers. You will complete various beginner exercises using a breadboard and finish with a final project.

## Retrospective

* What went well?
  * Kit worked out of the box
    * Tinkercad was great
    * Good github / Arduino.cc documentation
    * Good food (Thanks Chandy)
    * Pairing went well
  * What did not go well?
    * Driver installation
    * Switches low quality
  * Things worth discussing?
    * Overcomplicated the SOS challenge - 45 lines of code - rewrote without using delay()
    * Did I install a backdoor by downloading that driver from China? - unlikely
