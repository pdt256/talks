2018-11-01 - Youtube Data API Live Coding Presentation

30 min live coding presentation for the [Go Study Group](https://gophersource.com/study-group/). Questions extended to fill the full hour.

We explored how to write a Go command line application to upload a video to YouTube from scratch. We started with a negative demo to formalize the structure of the CLI application. Then we created a rough prototype to print the list of videos for the current user. Finally, we wrote the implementation to upload the video and created a pull request.
