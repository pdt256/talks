2020-04-17 - OAuth2 Event Modeling in Go - Part 1

1 hour presentation for the [Vancouver Event Driven Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Event-Driven/).

This was a presentation, followed with a Q&A session, about implementing OAuth2 in Go using CQRS and Event Sourcing. We discussed breaking down the OAuth2 domain into events, turning those into an event model, and implementing a solution guided by tests.
