# Projection Challenges

## Basic

* Count the number of events
* Count the number of deposits and withdrawals
* Get the total balance for the bank across all accounts
* Get the total running balance for the bank for each month

## Intermediate

* Find the top 5 accounts with the highest balance. Include account name and id.
* Find the top 5 accounts with the highest balance by month.

## Advanced
* Identify accounts that are structuring deposits under 10,000 over a period of time to avoid a
  Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).

> Structuring is the act of parceling what would otherwise be a large financial transaction
> into a series of smaller transactions to avoid scrutiny by regulators and law enforcement.


## Questions

* Can you reuse structures of your previous solution or do you create a new solution from scratch?
