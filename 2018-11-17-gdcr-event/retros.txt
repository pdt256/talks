TDD Exercise
* Learned: TDD, Pairing, Python
* Working in small increments
* Knowledge gaps were apparent
* At least 1 knows the language is all that was required
* Test cases helped identify simple gate solution

Baby Steps
* Focus on small problems
* Easy to see what fails
* Could get more done in 2 min than thought
* Less time typing, more time thinking
* Less rework, when we thought this challenge would involve more rework
* Simpler design using points instead of 2D matrix

TDD as if you meant it
* Given, When, Then
* Different solution after every exercise
* Forced to write detailed test name
